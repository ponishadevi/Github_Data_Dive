# GitHub Data Dive
# Overview
In the open-source world, GitHub is a key platform where developers collaborate and innovate. 
However, with millions of repositories available, it can be difficult for users to find the right projects,
 understand trends, or analyze technologies.

The aim of our project is to extract data from GitHub repositories using the GitHub API and 
uncover patterns in how repositories performâ€”such as their popularity, programming languages, and usage trends.

We will present these insights using a user-friendly Streamlit application to help developers, 
organizations, and researchers make informed decisions about collaborations, technology choices, and study materials.
